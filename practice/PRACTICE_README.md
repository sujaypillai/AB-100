## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### ❌ Rushing Through Questions
- Take time to read entire question
- Note keywords: "MOST", "BEST", "PRIMARY", "FIRST"
- Don't assume based on first few words

### ❌ Overlooking Details
- Scenario constraints matter (budget, timeline, compliance)
- Technical specifications are clues
- User/business requirements drive design

### ❌ Choosing "Advanced" When "Simple" Works
- Microsoft prefers practical solutions
- Don't over-engineer
- Consider: time to value, maintainability, cost

### ❌ Ignoring Microsoft-Specific Features
- Know Microsoft product capabilities
- Understand what's prebuilt vs. custom
- Favor integrated Microsoft solutions
