## Quick Reference

### Key Concepts

**Monitoring Pillars:**
- Performance metrics (latency, throughput, errors)
- Quality metrics (accuracy, user satisfaction)
- Cost metrics (token usage, compute costs)
- Business metrics (process efficiency, outcomes)

**ALM Stages:**
- Development → Build → Test → Deploy → Monitor → Iterate

**Security Layers:**
- Authentication and authorization
- Data encryption and residency
- Model security and access control
- Audit trails and compliance

**Responsible AI Principles:**
- Fairness
- Reliability and Safety
- Privacy and Security
- Inclusiveness
- Transparency
- Accountability

## Exam Weight
This domain accounts for **40-45%** of the exam questions - the largest portion!

## Study Approach
1. Understand monitoring tools and telemetry data interpretation
2. Practice creating test plans and validation criteria
3. Master ALM processes for different AI components
4. Deep dive into security and governance requirements
5. Study responsible AI principles and implementation
6. Learn about prompt injection and other AI vulnerabilities
7. Understand compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)

## Importance
This is the **highest-weighted domain** on the exam. Spend proportionally more time studying these topics. Focus on:
- Practical monitoring and troubleshooting
- ALM strategies for each platform
- Security best practices
- Governance frameworks
